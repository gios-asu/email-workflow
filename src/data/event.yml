event_description:
  >
    In 2009, Dennis McClung bought his first home in Mesa; it came with a big, broken pool. He converted the empty pool into a closed-loop, food-producing urban greenhouse. In the process, he inspired a community and created a nonprofit organization dedicated to researching and teaching sustainable ways of growing food.<br><br>

    In this talk, McClung will tell the story of <a href="http://gardenpool.org/" target="_blank">Garden Pool</a> and how a single idea can transform the way we think about growing food.<br><br>

    Lunch will be provided.
