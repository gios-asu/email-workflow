Dennis McClung

President and Founder of Garden Pool,
NPO

In 2009, Dennis McClung bought his first home
in Mesa; it came with a big, broken pool. He converted the empty
pool into a closed-loop, food-producing urban greenhouse. In the
process, he inspired a community and created a nonprofit
organization dedicated to researching and teaching sustainable
ways of growing food.
In this talk, McClung will tell the story of Garden Pool ( http://gardenpool.org/ ) and how a single idea can transform the
way we think about growing food.
Lunch will be provided.
